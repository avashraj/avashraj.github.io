# i learned
I studied the hough transform, a way to find lines in images by creating a "parameter" space by rearranging the terms in 
the line equation. Points in normal space correspond to lines in "parameter" space and we can find our line by grabbing the
point with the most lines intersecting it in "parameter" space". This won't work so we need to use polar coordinates. 

If we have two images and we want to find a real world point, linear triangulation is a way to do this. This is unrealistic
as this does not work with 2d images and a 3d scene. We need epipolar geometry for this. Epipolar geometry relates a 
3d point in the world, two cameras, their image planes on the same plane. The fundamental matrix is the algabraic representation
of this. It is formed with the skew symmetric matrix of an epipolar line multiplied with the 2d homography relating the two
images. We need at least 7 corresponding points to form the fundamental matrix. I have written more in my computer vision notes.
