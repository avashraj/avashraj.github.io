# i learned
i started the 3blue1brown linear algebra playlist again to brush up on my linear algebra knowledge. A vector can be thought
of in many different ways. A physicist might think of it as an arrow with a direction and a length. A computer scientist
might think of it as a list of numbers. They are the same. If we would draw a CS 2d vector on a coordinate plan starting
at the origin, we would have a 2d arrow with length and direction. We have two operations on these vectors: vector addition
and scalar multiplication. Vector addition is the addition of two vectors of same length element wise. So if we had
$$
\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} =
\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} a_1 + b_1 \\ a_2 + b_2 \\ a_3 + b_3 \end{bmatrix}
$$
Similarly for scalar multiplication:
$$
\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{bmatrix} * 2 = 
\begin{bmatrix} 2a_1 \\ 2a_2 \\ 2a_3 \end{bmatrix}
$$

I studied the hough transform. It is a way to find lines in images. I write about it here
