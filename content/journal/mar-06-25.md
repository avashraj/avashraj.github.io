# i learned

I am doing this a day late :(

I was helping a capstone team out with their project because it relates to my current work at school and I was able to work
through a git problem that someone had. He committed stuff locally but did not pull before comitting. 
I was able to recognize this problem and say you should reset your last commit but save the changes in your workspace. 
Then I guided him to stash his changes, pull remote changes, apply his stash and boom! No more git problem. This sounds
super simple, but I was feeling the day before that I was not good enough to do programming. Little victories like these
where my knowledge can help someone else reminds me that I can.
