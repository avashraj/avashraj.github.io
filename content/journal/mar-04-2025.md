I began studying for my circuit theory midterm next Wednesday. Ohm's law is $V = IR$. It states that the voltage across a 
resistor is equal to the current across if multiplied by the resistance. If we have two resistors in series, to get the 
equivalent resistance we simply add the two resistances together. If we have two resistors in parallel, we do
$$
\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}
$$

If we have a current passing through parallel resistors, we can use the current divider formula to find the currents across
each resistor. The formula is
$$
I_k = I_s * (\cfrac{\cfrac{1}{R_K}}{\cfrac{1}{R_1} + \cfrac{1}{R_2} + \dots + \cfrac{1}{R_n}})
$$

$R_k$ is the resistance of the resistor we want to find the current of. $I_s$ is the current in the whole circuit.
