# i learned
I began designing the system for my friends and I's startup. We will have a MacOS client, an API server, and an external Postgres DB. 
It was pretty fun trying to figure out what was the best options. ChatGPT is a big help because theres so many important things
that I have no idea about. For example I thought we could just enable HTTPS in our API framework and let it run. While this is possible 
with FastAPI, it is not industry standard. I want to work towards making everything I do standard industry procedure so I can better 
prepare myself for the job market. Instead we would have to enable SSL certificates and have NGINX act as a reverse proxy. A SSL 
certificate (secure socket i forgot the l) encrypts the data. A reverse proxy is a server that points to another server. 

I also studied more circuits. Fuck I am out of time now it is 11pm.
