# i learned

When coding with threads, two problems that may occur are **starvation** and **deadlock**. 

**Starvation** - a thread waits indefinitely; a scheduling issue

**Deadlock** - a circular waiting for resources exists within threads; happens when resource dependencies form
a cycle

there are 4 requirements for a deadlock: 
1) mutual exclusion - only one thread at a time can use a resource
2) hold and wait - a thread holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources
3) no preemption - resources are only voluntarily released by threads after they are finished with the resource
4) circular wait - there exists a set ${ T_1 \dots T_n}$ of waiting threads where $T_1$ waits on $T_2$ and $T_n$
waits on $T_1$
