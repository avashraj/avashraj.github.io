KVL is Kirchhoff's Voltage Law. It states that the sum of voltage drops and rise around a closed loop is zero. We treat voltage
rises as positive and voltage drops as negative. We make an equation for each loop. In a series circuit, the same current
flows through all components in a circuit. A branch is a single element in a circuit and a node is a point where 2 or more
components meet.
