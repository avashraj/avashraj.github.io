Mesh analysis is a circuit analysis technique where we create fake mesh currents in closed loops and apply KVL. With these
equations we can solve for whatever the problem asks for. Mesh analysis can only be done with planar circuits. To solve for 
a system of equations I started using the julia REPL. I have been wanting to learn julia for a few weeks and I finally found
a way to use it.

Type julia into your command line to start the REPL
```
A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]

B = [3; 6; 9]

x = A \ B
```
This is all the code it takes to solve this system of linear equations
