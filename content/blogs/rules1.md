I turn 21 in 32 days. I want to build certain habits before that because why haven't I already been doing these???

my rules for these 32 days are: 
 - wake up at 7
 - no electronics by 10:30
 - summarize everything I learned at 10
 - drink a gallon of water
 - write a blog post every week
 - write a notes post every week
