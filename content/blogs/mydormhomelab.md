I brought my old Thinkpad to school to install/practice linux on. I installed Ubuntu with Gnome successfully 
a while ago but I haven't used it at all. I've been babysitting this machine for 5ish months and I want to do 
something with it. Although I move out in 4 months, I decided to make a homelab with it. 


The computer is a Thinkpad with a ...i5 processor with 8gb of ram and 500gb of disk storage. The processor has
... cores so I decided to make .. virtual machines so I could play with distributed computing.
