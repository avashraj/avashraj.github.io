this is something i should have remembered/paid more attention to in my discrete math class but oh well. big o is one of
three different asymptotic notations.
aysmptotic notation describes the runtime of an algorithm based on a given input size n as n becomes very big.
kinda like a limit to infinity
big o is the upper bound of a function. basically if function1 = big O(function2), function1 will never grow faster than
function2.than" />
