I began designing the system for my friends and I&rsquo;s startup. We will have a MacOS client, an API server, and an external Postgres DB.
It was pretty fun trying to figure out what was the best options. ChatGPT is a big help because theres so many important things
that I have no idea about. For example I thought we could just enable HTTPS in our API framework and let it run. While this is possible
with FastAPI, it is not industry standard. I want to work towards making everything I do standard industry procedure so I can better
prepare myself for the job market. Instead we would have to enable SSL certificates and have NGINX act as a reverse proxy. A SSL
certificate (secure socket i forgot the l) encrypts the data. A reverse proxy is a server that points to another server." />
