Today I woke up at 7 am after going to bed at 11 and I felt awesome. Minus the fact that
I was really fucking sick. my head and body ached and i couldn&rsquo;t think straight. I had to
complete my calculator app and even though I felt shitty, I was able to go through it
much faster compared to yesterday. One error I could not figure out that ChatGPT found for
me was why when I tried to add two numbers it didn&rsquo;t add but simply combined it. Looking
back on this now I should have realized instantly. The output was getting concatentated
because I passed in the numbers as strings! I was so mad at myself that I didn&rsquo;t see that.
Besides that I didn&rsquo;t learn anything else. I had circuit theory lab where we had to make
more complex circuits with resistors. Breadboards are pretty cool I wish I had one." />
