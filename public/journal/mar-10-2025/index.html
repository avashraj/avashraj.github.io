When coding with threads, two problems that may occur are starvation and deadlock.
Starvation - a thread waits indefinitely; a scheduling issue
Deadlock - a circular waiting for resources exists within threads; happens when resource dependencies form
a cycle
there are 4 requirements for a deadlock:

mutual exclusion - only one thread at a time can use a resource
hold and wait - a thread holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources
no preemption - resources are only voluntarily released by threads after they are finished with the resource
circular wait - there exists a set ${ T_1 \dots T_n}$ of waiting threads where $T_1$ waits on $T_2$ and $T_n$
waits on $T_1$
