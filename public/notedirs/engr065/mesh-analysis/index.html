Find and label all meshes. A mesh is a closed loop that does not contain any other loops within it
Assume a clockwise current in each mesh/loop
Use KVL in each loop; use Ohm&rsquo;s law if necessary
Solve the system of equations

If there is a current source in between two meshes, we call that a super mesh. We can &lsquo;remove&rsquo; the supermesh and treat
the two loops as one loop. We make one big equation. We will also make another equation relating the current source to
the two mesh currents" />

<p>If there is a current source in between two meshes, we call that a super mesh. We can &lsquo;remove&rsquo; the supermesh and treat
the two loops as one loop. We make one big equation. We will also make another equation relating the current source to

<p>We will need an additional equation to deal with a dependant voltage source.</p>
