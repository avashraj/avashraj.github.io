A homography is a transformation matrix that takes you from one plane to another plane through a point of projection. The
problem we are trying to solve is given a set of matching features/points in 2d images, how can we find a homography that best
agrees with these points?
First when would this homography $H$ be valid?

when we are taking images of a plane
when the scene is very far(assumed at infinity) so it is a plane
when images are taken from the same point

How can we compute $H$?
The homography is a 3x3 matrix that transforms a point from the source image to the destination image. We can only compute
homography up to a scale factor so even though there are 9 values, we have 8 degrees of freedom. We would stack matching
points on top of each other to form a overdetermined system of equations. The stacked points would be $A$ in the equation,
$Ah = 0$. We have a constraint $||h||^2 = 1$ so we do not get the trivial solution. We want to minimize $||Ah||^2 \text{ such that }
||h||^2 =1$. With some math:" />

</ul>
<p>How can we compute $H$?
The homography is a 3x3 matrix that transforms a point from the source image to the destination image. We can only compute
homography up to a scale factor so even though there are 9 values, we have 8 degrees of freedom. We would stack matching
points on top of each other to form a overdetermined system of equations. The stacked points would be $A$ in the equation,
$Ah = 0$. We have a constraint $||h||^2 = 1$ so we do not get the trivial solution. We want to minimize $||Ah||^2 \text{ such that }
||h||^2 =1$. With some math:</p>
<p>$$
||Ah||^2 = (Ah)^T(AH) = h^T A^T Ah \text{ such that } h^th = 1
$$</p>
<p>We now make a loss function:
$$
L(h, \lambda) = h^T A^t Ah - \lambda(h^T h - 1)
$$</p>
<p>and derive it to get</p>
<p>$$
2A^t Ah - 2\lambda h = 0
$$</p>
<p>which is the eigenvalue problem</p>
<p>If we find the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue, we have our homography vector h. We can rearrange it to a 3x3 matrix
to get $H$.</p>
<p>Overall we</p>
<ol>
<li>use SIFT to get features</li>
<li>find matching features between the two points</li>
<li>make A by stacking source and destination image points</li>
<li>find the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue to get $H$</li>
</ol>
