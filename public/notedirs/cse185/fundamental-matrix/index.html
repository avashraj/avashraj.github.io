<p>The fundamental matrix $F$ is the algebraic representation of epipolar geometry. It is independant of the scene and can be
computed using corresponding points. We don&rsquo;t even need to know the camera intrinsics or extrinsics. There will be a 2d homography
$H_\pi$ mapping each $x_i$ to $x&rsquo;_i$ where $x_i$ is a point in img1 and $x&rsquo;_i$ is a point in img2.</p>
<p>The epipolar line in the image plane $l&rsquo;$ connects $e&rsquo;$ and $x&rsquo;$ can be written as the cross product between the points. We can make a
skew symmetric matrix with $e&rsquo;$ to make the cross operation part of a matrix multiplication like $[e&rsquo;]_x$. Now</p>
<p>$$
l&rsquo; = e&rsquo; \times x&rsquo; = [e&rsquo;]_x x'
$$</p>
<p>$$
x&rsquo; = H_\pi x
$$</p>
<p>The benefit is that we can chain the cross products now. The fundamental matrix is the skew symmetric matrix of $e&rsquo;$ multiplied
to the homography matrix $H_\pi$. If $x$ and $x&rsquo;$ are corresponding points, $X&rsquo;^T Fx = 0$.</p>
<p>$l&rsquo; = Fx$ is the epipolar line corresponding to $x$.</p>
<p>$l = F^T e&rsquo; = 0$ is the epipolar line corresponding to $x'$</p>
<p>$F e = 0$</p>
<p>$F^T e&rsquo; = 0$</p>
<p>Each corresponding point pair gives one equation and we need at least 7 correspondences to compute F.</p>
<p>$H_\pi$ has rank 3, $[e&rsquo;]_x$ has rank 2, and F has rank 2</p>
