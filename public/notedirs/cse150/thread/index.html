<p>A thread is the smallest unique unit of execution in a CPU. It is also the smallest piece of execution that can be
scheduled independently by a scheduler in an operating system. A thread has its own</p>
<ul>
<li>set of registers</li>

<h3 id="tcb"><strong>TCB</strong></h3>
<p>Every thread has its own thread control block which is a data structure that holds important information about that thread.
A TCB contains</p>
<ul>
<li>a unique ID</li>
<li>the thread&rsquo;s PC or pointer to its next instruction</li>
<li>pointer to its stack</li>
<li>state of the thread eg. ready, waiting, running</li>
<li>the registers that would be in the CPU registers if it was running</li>
<li>its priority in terms of scheduling</li>
<li>a pointer to its associated process/PCB</li>
</ul>
<p>We need a uniform data structure for threads for efficient context switching.</p>
